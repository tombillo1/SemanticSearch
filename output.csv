"The Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack  on the United States Capitol, having considered this Report,  reports favorably thereon and recommends that the Report be  approved."
"The form of the Resolution that the Select Committee to  Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol  would recommend to the House of Representatives for citing  Jeffrey Bossert Clark for contempt of Congress pursuant to this  Report is as follows:     Resolved, That Jeffrey Bossert Clark shall be found to be  in contempt of Congress for failure to comply with a  congressional subpoena."
"Resolved, That pursuant to 2 USC 192 and 194,  the Speaker of the House of Representatives shall certify the  report of the Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th  Attack on the United States Capitol, detailing the refusal of  Jeffrey Bossert Clark to produce documents or answer questions  during a deposition before the Select Committee to Investigate  the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol as directed  by subpoena, to the United States Attorney for the District of  Columbia, to the end that Mr. Clark be proceeded against in the  manner and form provided by law."
"Resolved, That the Speaker of the House shall otherwise  take all appropriate action to enforce the subpoena."
"PURPOSE AND SUMMARY      On January 6, 2021, a violent mob breached the security  perimeter of the United States Capitol, assaulted and injured  scores of police officers, engaged in hand-to-hand violence  with those officers over an extended period, and invaded and  occupied the Capitol building, all in an effort to halt the  lawful counting of electoral votes and reverse the results of  the 2020 presidential election."
"In the words of many of those  who participated in the violence, the attack was a direct  response to false statements by then-President Trump--beginning  on election night 2020 and continuing through January 6, 2021-- that the 2020 election had been stolen by corrupted voting  machines, widespread fraud, and otherwise."
"In response, the House adopted House Resolution 503 on June  30, 2021, establishing the Select Committee to Investigate the  January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol (hereinafter  referred to as the ``Select Committee'')."
"The Select Committee is investigating the facts,  circumstances, and causes of the January 6th attack and issues  relating to the peaceful transfer of power, in order to  identify how the events of January 6th were planned, what  actions and statements motivated and contributed to the attack  on the Capitol, how the violent riot that day was coordinated  with a political and public relations strategy to reverse the  election outcome, and why the Capitol security was insufficient  to address what occurred."
"The Select Committee will evaluate  all facets of these issues, create a public record of what  occurred, and recommend to the House, and its relevant  committees, corrective laws, policies, procedures, rules, or  regulations."
"According to documents and testimony gathered by the Select  Committee, in the weeks leading up to the January 6th attack on  the U.S. Capitol, Jeffrey Bossert Clark participated in efforts  to delegitimize the results of the 2020 presidential election  and delay or interrupt the peaceful transfer of power."
"As  detailed in a report issued by the U.S. Senate Judiciary  Committee (hereinafter ``Senate Report'') and press accounts,  after numerous courts throughout the United States had  resoundingly rejected alleged voter fraud challenges to the  election results by the Trump campaign, and after all states  had certified their respective election results, Mr. Clark  proposed that the Department of Justice (DOJ) send a letter to  officials of the State of Georgia and other States suggesting  that they call special legislative sessions to investigate  allegations of voter fraud and consider appointing new slates  of electors."
"In violation of DOJ policy and after a direct  admonition from the Acting Attorney General of the United  States, Mr. Clark also met with White House officials,  including then-President Trump, to discuss efforts to  delegitimize, disrupt, or overturn the election results."
"To  further these efforts, President Trump considered installing  Mr. Clark as the Acting Attorney General, a plan that was  abandoned only after much of the DOJ leadership team and the  White House Counsel threatened to resign if Mr. Clark was  appointed."
